Laplacian Edge Detection

What is Laplacian:
Laplacian edge detection is a second-order derivative method that detects edges by identifying areas where intensity changes rapidly in all directions.

How it works:

Apply the Laplacian operator using kernel to measure rapid intensity changes.

Regions with sharp changes represent edges or boundaries.

Example:
When applied to an image of coins, the circular outlines of each coin become clearly visible.
