Edge Detection Using DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform)

Edge Detection is the process of identifying boundaries between regions in an image where intensity changes sharply. Edges often correspond to object boundaries, texture changes, or important structural details.

Using DWT for Edge Detection:

Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT):

DWT decomposes an image into different frequency components at multiple scales (resolutions).

It produces sub-bands:

LL (approximation): Low-frequency content (smooth regions)

LH (horizontal edges), HL (vertical edges), HH (diagonal edges)

Edge Detection Process:

Apply DWT to the input image to obtain the sub-bands.

The LH, HL, and HH sub-bands highlight intensity changes in horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions, respectively.

Combine or threshold these high-frequency sub-bands to create an edge map.

Advantages:

Multi-resolution analysis: detects edges at different scales.

Better noise resilience compared to simple gradient-based methods.

Can capture subtle texture and structural details.
