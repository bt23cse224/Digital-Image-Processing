Histogram Sliding (Brightness Adjustment): This method shifts all pixel intensity values by a fixed amount, either increasing or decreasing brightness.

Effect: Makes the image lighter or darker without changing contrast.

How: Adds or subtracts a constant value to each pixel, clipping values to stay within 0â€“255.
