What is KNN (k-Nearest Neighbors)?

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple and intuitive supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.
It is based on the idea that similar data points exist close to each other in feature space.

How KNN Works

Training Phase:

It simply stores all the training data and their labels.

Prediction Phase:

When a new (unknown) sample is given, KNN calculates the distance (commonly Euclidean) between this sample and all points in the training data.

It then finds the k nearest neighbors (the k samples with the smallest distances).

The new sample is assigned the most common class among those k neighbors (majority voting).

Key Parameter — k:

A small k makes the model sensitive to noise.

A large k makes the model smoother but can blur class boundaries.
