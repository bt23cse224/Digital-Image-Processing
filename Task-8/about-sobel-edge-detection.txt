Sobel Edge Detection

What is Sobel:
Sobel edge detection is a first-order derivative method that detects edges by measuring the gradient (rate of change) of intensity in the horizontal and vertical directions.

How it works:

Apply Sobel kernels (one for horizontal, one for vertical) to the image.

Calculate the gradient magnitude from these two components.

Regions with high gradient magnitude correspond to edges.

Example:
When applied to an image of coins, the edges of each coin become highlighted, showing the boundaries clearly in both horizontal and vertical directions.
