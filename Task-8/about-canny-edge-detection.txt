Canny Edge Detection

What is Canny:
Canny edge detection is a multi-step, more advanced method that detects edges with high accuracy while reducing noise.

How it works:

Noise reduction: Apply Gaussian filter to smooth the image.

Gradient computation: Calculate intensity gradients (like Sobel).

Non-maximum suppression: Thin out edges by keeping only local maxima in gradient direction.

Double thresholding: Classify edges as strong, weak, or non-edges based on gradient magnitude.

Edge tracking: Connect weak edges to strong edges if they are linked.

Example:
When applied to a coin image, the Canny detector produces thin, clean outlines of each coin, with minimal noise and well-defined boundaries.
